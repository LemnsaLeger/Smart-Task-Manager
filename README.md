# üé£ TaskFisher: Pomodoro Task Manager

A clean, minimalist application designed to help you catch and conquer your to-dos. TaskFisher blends simple task organization with the powerful productivity technique of the Pomodoro Timer, running entirely in your browser using **IndexedDB** for secure, private, and persistent storage.

## ‚ú® Features

TaskFisher is built around focused work sessions and intelligent project tracking to maximize your productivity.

### üçÖ Focused Work & Tracking

  * **Integrated Pomodoro Timer:** Start a focused work session directly on any task.
  * **Custom Intervals:** Set and save custom durations for Work, Short Break, and Long Break intervals. These settings are saved per-task, so the timer remembers your preferences.
  * **Time Tracking:** Automatically track and permanently save the **Total Time Taken** for any task once it's marked as complete.
  * **Completion Status:** When a task is completed, the timer stops, and the task status bar displays **"Completed\!"** instead of the due date.

### üìä Project Management & Progress

  * **Project Completion:** Dynamic progress bars show the percentage of tasks completed within a project.
  * **"In Progress" Filter:** A project is automatically designated **"In Progress"** (and displayed in a dedicated section) if it has at least one associated task.
  * **Full CRUD:** Complete functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both Projects and Tasks.
  * **Today's Tasks:** Dedicated view to filter tasks by priority, due date, and custom tags.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technology

  * **React:** For the dynamic, component-based user interface.
  * **IndexedDB:** Used for all data storage, ensuring your tasks remain private, local, and load instantly.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** For a clean, modern, and utility-first design approach.

### **A Note on IndexedDB**

Since TaskFisher relies on **IndexedDB**, be mindful when changing the data structure. If you introduce a new required field (like `totalTimeTaken`), ensure your changes handle:

1.  **New Tasks:** Initializing the field with a default value in the creation logic.
2.  **Old Tasks:** Gracefully handling older tasks that might not have the field (e.g., using optional chaining `task.newField || defaultValue`).
